# A Cruise Down Vietnam Lane

This is quintessential [Vietnam](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelostpassport.com%2Fvietnam-motorbike-itinerary%2F&psig=AOvVaw1ZamOxOokkL5v0eZVpC90V&ust=1603458967280000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCIjU96akyOwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

I frequently look back at my time in Vietnam, _long_ to be back on that Honda Winner, _dream_ about being back in that headspace I was in, _crave_ to eat Vietnamese street food, simply _wish_ to be among the Vietnamese people again. 

## Things I Look Back On:

* The freedom of being on a bike
* Untouched jungles
* Clear beaches
* $3 meals
* The uncomfort of being in a small village where no one speaks English
* The homestays
* Having no agenda
* Making friends like Sam and Martina
* Ha Long Bay
* The absolute **chaos** of the road
* Noodles
* Morning pancakes and cigarettes
* Baloons
* Being mistaken as Vietnamese - "you vietnam?"
* The **beautiful** people

I could spend all day on this list and I am afraid I still wouldn't accurately portray my feelings in this post. It truly is a magical place. I recommend you see so for yourself.
